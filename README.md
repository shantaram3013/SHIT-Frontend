### (Shan's Handwriting Input Tool - Frontend)

***built with NW.js (https://nwjs.io)***

instructions for testers:

   1) get NW.js from their website. (SDK or normal build does not matter.)
   2) clone the repo
   3) Launch it with `GDK_BACKEND=x11 /path/to/nw_extraction_dir/nw --disable-gpu --force-cpu-draw --enable-transparent-visuals --disable-gpu-compositing /path/to/SHIT-Frontend`
   4) Use a stylus (or hold down left-mouse and move the mouse) to draw, hold the right-click button on your stylus or mouse to erase.

**Note**: handwriting recognition does not actually work yet, this build is simply to test cell sizing etc
